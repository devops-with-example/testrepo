## The first day of learning GIT ##

Commands that i used today -

git status
(This shows the status of changes as untracked, modified or staged.)

git log
(keeps track of every commit done. Makes it easy to identify changes)

git diff
(Shows the difference in the actul saved file in repo and the local file changes)

git remote add origin <URL>
(Used to set the github location where it's going to be pushed."origin" is the nickname to be used later in push commands)

git remote set-url origin git@github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
(This is done to set the remote url again. Here i'm setting ssh url so that i can proceed with public key authenticationprocess)

git remote -v
(This shows the remote url saved for pushing to github location)

## For making passwordless "git push" generated ssh-keygen and pasted the public key id-rsa.pub on Github ssh. ##

git add "file name"
(This adds the file to be tracked)

git commit -m ""
(This puts the file in the staging area along with the message, That can be tracked via log)

git push -u origin master
(here, origin is the nickname of the set remote location and master is the branch. push is simply pushing to the remote origin in master branch.)

################ Removing the file from the github repo ##########################

git rm -f FILENAME
(Used to remove file forcefully from local)

git commit -m "Removing the file"
(Staging the  removal of file along with message)

git push origin master
(Pushing the changes to the remote location. This ultimately removes the file from the repo)
