## The first day of learning GIT ##

Commands that i used today -

git status
(This shows the overall status of git)

git log
(keeps track of every commit done. Makes it easy to identify changes)

git remote add origin <URL>
(Used to set the github location where it's going to be pushed."origin" is the nickname to be used later in push commands)

git remote set-url origin git@github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
(This is done to set the remote url again. Here i'm setting ssh url so that i can proceed with public key authenticationprocess)

git remote -v
(This shows the remote url saved for pushing to github location)

## For making passwordless "git push" generated ssh-keygen and pasted the public key id-rsa.pub on Github ssh. ##

git add "file name"
(This adds the file to be tracked)

git commit -m ""
(This puts the file in the staging area along with the message, That can be tracked via log)

git push -u origin master
(here, origin is the nickname of the set remote location and master is the branch. push is simply pushing to the remote origin in master branch.)
